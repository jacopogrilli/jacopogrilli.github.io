( <i class="fa fa-child"></i> marks activities that kids might particularly enjoy )


### Moving in Trieste


<!--*Trieste's urban territory lies at the foot of an imposing escarpment that comes down abruptly from the Karst Plateau towards the sea.*<br>-->
<!--You will have the natural tendency to stay on the 1D line between ICTP and the center (which is all by the sea and all flat). Going up to the Karst require to pass a barrier potential, but it's definitely worth to explore it.-->



Google Maps is quite accurate for public buses ([official timetable](https://www.triestetrasporti.it/en/time-schedule-and-routes/lines-and-timetables/), you can get the ticket at ICTP).

The buses to different villages on Karst are 42, 43 and 44.


[Ferries](https://www.delfinoverde.it/servizi-di-linea/) from Center to Muggia (all year) and from Center to Sistiana (from June to Sept).

### Restaurants

Always better to reserve. The summer and the fisrt weekend of October (Barcolana) are expecially busy periods

A very typical/unique "culinary feature" are [Osmiza](https://www.discover-trieste.it/code/15948/Osmizas)s. Check the ones open [here](https://www.osmize.com/eng.html).
They are endemic in Karst (the ones in Prosecco/Contovello are at walking distance from ICTP, with some elevation, [Here the route](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=45.70383%2C13.719956&point=45.705711%2C13.727837&point=45.704804%2C13.730524&point=45.708088%2C13.733563&profile=foot&layer=Omniscale)
from Galielo Guesthouse to Prosecco/Contovello).
Food is mostly pork based. 

Another food institution unique to Trieste are [Buffet](https://flavorsoffriuli.com/5-historic-buffets-of-trieste/). Good ones close to the center are
[Da Pepi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j3bA4uWdJaRnuaEV6),
[Da Gildo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NQssSvfo3Lc24tbz8),
[Marascutti](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s7MR9BTsc5fqWyKa9). 

[Tavernetta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KdXskBv1QzawjFLG9). Seafood, next to adriatico guesthouse.
An alternative close to ICTP is [La Terrazza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5yorx5XDC7skxpj27).

[Alla Sorgente](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xxHx6AhaiwA6dXMP7). Seafood. Call in advance.

[Suban](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cbvQRcvUVKGZCAvE7). Old style restaurant, more expensive that the average. It's where politicians (and popes) go when they come to Trieste. Need to take a bus from the center.

[Osteria Marise](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X4856NRpsUr3pivh9).

[Osteria Da Marino](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1QBZgkc8vyhsooMB8)

[Osteria Alla Valle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EtPGghLdC4yYy7pb9). Seafood, home-made pasta, no menu (you get what the owner wants), small.

[Casa Pepe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HEakLtnsQJCnCXnUA), [Bianco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oFox8ifhbyC4yVqk6), [San Genna'](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mmGHeoDeNnVcE12W8),
[Mancini](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f8uC6c9PF7mJbJhH9), [Barattolo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NtBvucrei1fqtBdaA) are all good pizza places

[Trattoria sociale di Prosecco](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nK5P4ZaxuJxXeogb8). Typical Karst place in Prosecco. <br>
It is possible to reach it on foot from ICTP via a well mantained trail (dark at night).
[Here the route](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=45.70383%2C13.719956&point=45.705711%2C13.727837&point=45.704804%2C13.730524&point=45.708088%2C13.733563&profile=foot&layer=Omniscale)
from Galielo Guesthouse.

[Da Pino](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xs8FR4DqMKorjTcQ8). Ok pizza, good for big groups

From Galileo Guesthouse to [Monte Grisa](https://www.discover-trieste.it/code/17480/Marian-Sanctuary-in-Monte-Grisa) (best panoramic point on the gulf). [Panoramic](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=45.703859%2C13.719922&point=45.70239%2C13.72858&point=45.701542%2C13.733381&point=45.70295%2C13.736313&point=45.699576%2C13.739018&point=45.69757%2C13.742692&point=45.695057%2C13.745828&point=45.694123%2C13.749735&point=45.692766%2C13.750058&profile=foot&layer=Omniscale) and the [fastest](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=45.703859%2C13.719922&point=45.705667%2C13.727728&point=45.705765%2C13.728871&point=45.70295%2C13.736313&point=45.698628%2C13.741027&point=45.694123%2C13.749735&point=45.692766%2C13.750058&profile=foot&layer=Omniscale)
<br>
[This](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=45.703859%2C13.719922&point=45.705667%2C13.727728&point=45.705765%2C13.728871&point=45.70295%2C13.736313&point=45.698628%2C13.741027&point=45.698411%2C13.741209&profile=foot&layer=Omniscale)
is the fastest way from Galileo Guesthouse to [Napoleonica](https://www.discover-trieste.it/code/16325/Napoleonic-Way) <br>

### Biking

There are a couple of bike rentals in the center ([this](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sZg9cmhUou5fDmwF8) and [that](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SBEyycziJmjLtTYV9)), which I never tried.
There is also a bike sharing program [Bits](https://mobilitasostenibile.comune.trieste.it/) 


[Giordano Cottur Cycling Path](https://www.discover-trieste.it/en/15841/The-Giordano-Cottur-walking-cycling-path). From San Giacomo (close to the center) up to the Karst, with great overlooking on Rosandra Valley.


If you have several days: Parenzana (or a portion of it).
<br>
[Offical website](https://www.parenzana.net/en) |  [Maps and gpx](http://www.parenzana.it/) (only in Italian) | 
[Article on the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/24/travel/bike-ride-italy-croatia.html)
<br>
The first part (from Trieste city-center to Muggia) is not very nice for bikes. The suggestion is to take the ferry from the city center to Muggia (you can bring bikes on the ferry).

### Running


(you can export *.gpx* files from the links below. These files can be opened with several phone app... Komoot, Wikiloc, AllTrails, Strava, etc)

(check the distances... some are one-way other are loops / include return.)

If you want to run flat on concrete the best is to run [from/to Miramare caste to/from piazza Unit√† d'Italia](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=45.701552%2C13.718453&point=45.67334%2C13.757296&point=45.656739%2C13.770399&point=45.645852%2C13.75959&profile=foot&layer=Omniscale). There are plenty of water fountains on the way. 

Still on concrete, but a bit more hilly, you can start [from behind the Galileo Guesthouse and stay on via Plinio / via del Pucino](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=45.703859%2C13.719922&point=45.735412%2C13.682695&profile=foot&layer=Omniscale).

[This](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=&point=45.699282%2C13.725484&profile=car&layer=Omniscale) has a stair access and free cold shower.
