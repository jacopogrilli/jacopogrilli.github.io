I am a Postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago, working in the lab of [Stefano Allesina](http://allesinalab.uchicago.edu/).
I graduated in Physics in 2011 at the University of Milan and I obtained a Ph.D in Physics in 2015 at the University of Padova, where I was supervised by [Amos Maritan](http://www.pd.infn.it/~maritan/).

-In January 2018, I will start as a [Omidyar Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/jacopo-grilli) at the Santa Fe Institute.-

I am a biological physicist, with a background in statistical physics and strong experience
in interdisciplinary projects and collaborations. Broadly speaking, I am interested in understanding complex phenomena starting from simple rules and minimal assumptions. Most
of my [research](/research) is in theoretical ecology, with a particular focus on ecological networks and
neutral theory. I am also working on problems in genomics and cell physiology and, more
recently, I started working on aging and stress response in C. elegans.
