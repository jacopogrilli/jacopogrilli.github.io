  description: "Life populates almost every corner of this planet, with striking differences
                            of forms and shapes, that reflect the adaptation to a particular environment and
                            unique evolutionary histories. Despite the contingency of the processes shaping genomes, remarkable
                            regularities and patterns can be found across organisms.
                            We studied how different patterns involving genes with the same
                            functions were connected to patterns of evolutionary closely related genes

                            We also studied the role of HGT in shaping the genomes of prokaryotes and
                            the relation between genes occurrence and HGT
