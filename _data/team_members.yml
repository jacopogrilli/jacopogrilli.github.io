  description: I am a biological physicist, with a background in statistical physics. Broadly speaking, I am interested in understanding complex phenomena starting from simple rules and minimal assumptions. Most of my research is at the interface between statistical physics and ecology, with a particular focus on coexistence, stability, and variability. I also work on different problems in genomics and cell physiology.

  description: "I study the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities. Though I am a biologist by training, I am fascinated with views of biological systems that are grounded in statistical physics. At ICTP I am working to build a physicist's intuition of microbial ecology and evolution through empirical and theoretical means. My current research is focused on connecting macroecological predictions to experimental data and the application of macroecological principles to patterns of genetic diversity in the human gut microbiome."

  description: "As a PhD student, I am fascinated by the complex role that microbial interactions play in the structure and function of microbial communities. The significance of microbial interactions cannot be overstated, particularly in the context of debilitating conditions such as different types of cancer, Crohn's disease or cystic fibrosis. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of the microbiome, enabling us to predict the efficacy of microbiome-based medical treatments."

My goal is to achieve analytical results in Individual-Based Models (currently, applied to evolution and species formation). To this aim, I use techniques from dynamical systems, stochastic processes and statistical mechanics, but since these are very broad theoretical fields, my interests may spread over other IBMs whenever I am able to apply this toolkit."

As a physicist, I attempt to analyze biological systems across spatiotemporal scales using fundamental principles, generalizations, and idealized models. As a quantitative biology student, my duty is to learn to tame these (seemingly) wild abstractions by appropriating necessary biophysical constraints, narrowing down the range of implications to what can be physiologically realizable and interpretable - whatever living system they may be applied to. Currently, I am a visiting research fellow at the ICTP where I will attempt to model the eco-evolutionary dynamics of strains within the human gut, in order to characterize population trajectories at the edge of ecological differentiation."
