  description: I am a biological physicist, with a background in statistical physics. Broadly speaking, I am interested in understanding complex phenomena starting from simple rules and minimal assumptions. Most of my research is at the interface between statistical physics and ecology, with a particular focus on coexistence, stability, and variability. I also work on different problems in genomics and cell physiology.

  description: "I am a physicist who became fascinated with ecology. My research is driven by the curiosity to understand how the macroscopic patterns and behaviours that we observe in ecosystems emerge from the complex interactions of a large number of entities. I am especially interested in understanding the roles of interactions, environmental fluctuations and trait heterogeneity in shaping communities, their composition and their variability."

  description: "I am a theoretical physicist interested in biophysics, non equilibrium statistical mechanics and their interfaces. My focus is on  two themes (but I love to get dispersed): coexistence, variation and interaction in microbial ecosystem, combining data and models; bacterial phenotypic evolution, studying both  abstract theory to emphasize its out of equilibrium dynamics, and empirically grounded models."
