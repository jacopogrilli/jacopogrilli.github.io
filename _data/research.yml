- title: "Statistical patterns of empirical microbial communities"
  description: We study the patterns of diversity, abundance, and variation of microbial communities
            from a macroecological standpoint. By studying these patterns, we aim at identifying and quantify the contributions of the different ecological
            forces that shape communities composition across spatial and temporal scales.
            We use the patterns to identify simple (but not trivial) models that predict them [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18529-y">NC2020</a>],
            and we use the models to identify novel patters which, by invalidating the simpler model, reveal novel ecological insights
            on community structure and dynamics [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abj2882">SciAdv2021</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010043">PlosCB2022</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.12.499693">BiorXiv2022</a>].


- title: "Theoretical microbial ecology and evolution"
  description: We develop theory to describe the ecology and evolution of (mostly microbial) communities. We tend to formulate
        mathematical tractable models to shape our intuition about ecological and evolutionary models, and why try to push the boundaries
        of what is tractable, by borrowing advnced methods from stochastic processes, disordered systems, and random matrix theory.
        We are particularly, but not exclusively, interested in the interface between ecology and evolution, both on how non-trivial ecological structure influence
        the evolution of population [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.448795">BiorXiv2022</a>] and
        how the evolution of relevant-ecological traits determine the community structure and
        composition [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.02.438173">BiorXiv2022</a>]. While we appreciate
        purely theoretical and conceptual projects, we also enjoy very much to develop theory, and put it into a test, working together with
        experimental collaborators

#- title: "Variation and diversity in microbial communities"
#  description: How coexistence of many species is maintained is a fundamental and
#        unanswered question in ecology.
#        Coexistence is a puzzle because we lack a quantitative understanding of the variation in species presence and 
#        abundance. Whether variation in ecological communities is driven by deterministic
#        or random processes is one of the most controversial issues in 
 #       ecology. We studied the variation of species presence and abundance in
#        microbial communities from a macroecological standpoint, identifying three 
#        novel, universal, and foundamental macroecological laws

  description: Ecosystems are typically composed by a large number of interacting individuals
        and species. What do determine their stability respect to perturbation
        and their persistence in time?
        The first lesson of statistical physics is that we cannot use the same methods that
        we use to study the motion of two bodies to describe a tank of gas. Following
        a long tradition in theoretical ecology, we study stability and persistence
        of ecosystems using random matrices. This approach allows to identify what are
        the relevant quantities that determine the fate of those systems.
        In particular we were able to find a stability condition for empirical
        food-webs
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8842">NC2015a</a>],
        to characterize how perturbations spread across species
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10179">NC2015b</a>],
        and to link modularity and stability [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12031">NC2016</a>].
        We also studied the probability to observe a randomly interacting set of species coexist
        [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14389">NC2017</a>]
        and what is the typical number of species coexisting
        [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0603-6/">NatE&E2018</a>].
        We showed that higher-order interactions have a strong effect on stability of ecological communties

- title: "Cell-size control"
  with: "M. Cosentino Lagomarsino, G. Micali, M. Osella"
  description: The dream of every cell is to become two cells. Without a coupling between cell size and
        division, cells would not have the experimentally observed stationary distribution of sizes.
        How this control is coordinated  has not been yet understood.
        We showed that the statistical properties of size and time of division can be explained using scaling arguments,
        without the need of invoking specific mechanisms
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.012408">PRE2016</a>].
        Scaling allows, in fact, to connect
        apparently unrelated measurable quantities in a parameter-free setting. On the other hand,
        we characterized the class of models compatible with scaling, isolating few parameters that
        describe cell-size control across species and conditions
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032411">PRE2017</a>] and
        we study their dependence on cell-growth fluctuations [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01541/full">frontMB2018</a>]. We studied the empirical correlation patterns of DNA replication and cell division showing that no master control
        is needed to achieve the observed coordination [<a target="_blank" href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/11/eaau3324?rss=1&intcmp=trendmd-adv">SciAdv2018</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124718315067">CellRep2018</a>].

  with: "M. Cosentino Lagomarsino, S. Maslov"
  past: 1
  description: Life populates almost every corner of this planet, with striking differences
        of forms and shapes, that reflect the adaptation to a particular environment and
        unique evolutionary histories. Despite the contingency of the processes shaping genomes, remarkable
        regularities and patterns can be found across organisms.
        We studied how different patterns involving genes with the same
        functions were connected to patterns of evolutionary closely related genes
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr7112">NAR2012</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/13/7615/3865434">NAR2017</a>].
        We also studied the role of HGT in shaping the genomes of prokaryotes and
        the relation between genes occurrence and HGT

- title: "Neutral theory and spatial ecology"
  with: "S. Azaele, J.R. Banavar, A. Maritan"
  past: 1
  description: Macroscopic phenomena are intrinsically stochastic and noise strongly affects
        the species composition and diversity of ecosystems. Statistical mechanics
        offers many tools that
        can be applied to study these systems
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.88.035003">RMP2016</a>].
        We showed how spatial dispersal of species makes ecosystems inevitably out of equilibrium
        [<a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/100/38002">EPL2012</a>]. While this
        fact makes simple models analytically untractable, there is still room
        for analytical solutions in spatially explicit systems. Using a phenomenological
        model we were able to connect different spatial and non-spatial ecological patterns

#  description: Scale-free phenomena are quite common in biological and social systems.
#        In condensed matter physics long range correlations emerges by fine-tuning
#        the parameters to a critical point. Whether these observations are truly
#        signatures of criticality is still an open problem and
#        we are trying to find ways to identify
#        in an unbiased way criticality in empirical data.
#        We proposed a general
#        framework, based on information theory and amenable of analytical treatment
